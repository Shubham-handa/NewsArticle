iOS
---

iOS is a mobile operating system which is developed by Apple for supporting their particular hardware like iPhone, iPod touch, and iPad.
Whether you are the owner of an iPhone or an Android smartphone, you have likely stumbled upon the label of  “iOS app” when browsing new apps to download. IPhone App Developers use the term “iOS” to differentiate Android versus Apple-based phones, so users are quickly informed whether the app they are interested in is compatible with the phone they own. With mobile app development skyrocketing in the past decade, iPhone app development companies use the label “iOS” for Apple users, which stands for “iPhone Operating System”.
